# Dev Notes: 
- to automatically generate a React component: npm run generate 
- to run: npm run start (will be changed to Docker container) 
- update constants file for text 


# Tech Debt 
- plop js automation actions needs to be updated, more advanced CLI can be developed 
- create Docker container 
- rename shit 
- move common styles to styles.js 
- host the appwrite 
- some html components use className and class
it's just a fucking mess rn 
finish setting up the backend 
- the images need to be hd or wtv @Vidushi can you plz render new ones with the exact dimensions i have rn for them but they are hd 


# Tech Stack: 
- React 
- Tailwind  
- Headless UI (for menu, other behaviour functions) 
- AppWrite.io 
- Docker
